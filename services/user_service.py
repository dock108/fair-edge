Fair-Edge User Service Layer

PRODUCTION-READY USER AUTHENTICATION AND CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

This module provides centralized user authentication, role management, and
context handling for the Fair-Edge platform. It eliminates duplicate user
logic across endpoints and provides consistent authentication patterns
with graceful guest access fallbacks.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
==================

1. User Context Management:
   - Unified user authentication across all endpoints
   - Graceful fallback to guest access for unauthenticated users
   - Role-based feature access control
   - Consistent user metadata for API responses

2. Authentication Patterns:
   - Cookie-based session management
   - JWT token validation fallbacks
   - Guest user support for free tier access
   - Production-ready error handling

3. Role-Based Access Control:
   - Feature flags based on user roles (Free/Basic/Premium/Admin)
   - Dynamic permission checking
   - Subscription status integration
   - Secure role validation

PRODUCTION BENEFITS:
===================

- Eliminates duplicate authentication logic across endpoints
- Provides consistent user experience for all access levels
- Enables graceful degradation for unauthenticated users
- Comprehensive error handling prevents authentication failures
- Centralized role management simplifies permission updates

SECURITY FEATURES:
=================

- Secure session validation with multiple fallback strategies
- Role-based data filtering and access control
- Guest access isolation with limited permissions
- Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring

DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
================

- Thread-safe for concurrent requests
- Minimal performance overhead
- Extensive error logging for production monitoring
- Compatible with horizontal scaling
- Clean separation of concerns for maintainability

USAGE PATTERNS:
==============

# Simple user context:
user = get_user_or_guest(request)

# Full context manager:
user_ctx = UserContextManager(request)
if user_ctx.is_guest:
    # Handle guest user
elif user_ctx.role == "premium":
    # Handle premium user

# Response metadata:
metadata = create_user_response_metadata(user)

def get_user_or_guest(request: Request) -> UserCtx:
    """
    Get authenticated user or create guest user context with graceful fallback.

    This function implements the core authentication pattern used throughout
    Fair-Edge, providing a consistent approach to user context management
    with graceful degradation to guest access for unauthenticated requests.

    Authentication Flow:
    1. Attempt to extract user from secure session cookies
    2. Validate session data and user permissions
    3. Fall back to guest user context if authentication fails
    4. Log authentication attempts for security monitoring

    Returns:
        UserCtx: Either authenticated user or guest user with free tier access

    Guest User Benefits:
    - Enables free tier access without requiring authentication
    - Provides limited but functional access to core features
    - Allows users to experience the platform before signing up
    - Implements role-based restrictions automatically

    Security Considerations:
    - Authentication failures are logged but don't expose sensitive information
    - Guest users have strictly limited access to prevent abuse
    - Session validation includes comprehensive security checks
    - All user context includes role and subscription status validation

    Production Notes:
    - Thread-safe for concurrent requests
    - Minimal latency impact on API performance
    - Comprehensive error handling prevents authentication failures
    - Consistent user context format across all endpoints

    Example:
        >>> user = get_user_or_guest(request)
        >>> if user.role == "guest":
        ...     # Apply free tier restrictions
        >>> else:
        ...     # Full authenticated user access
