          <div className="education-content">
            <p>Our tool isn't just comparing odds - we're trying to find situations where the market has mispriced a bet. Think of it like finding a stock that's trading below its "true" value.</p>
            
            <div className="strategy-box">
              <div className="strategy-title">üí° Our Core Strategy</div>
              <p>We use <strong>Pinnacle as our "anchor book"</strong> because they have the sharpest lines and lowest margins. Then we look for other books offering significantly different odds on the same outcome. When we find big differences, there might be value.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>The goal is to post odds on betting exchanges that give us a mathematical edge - similar to how a casino has an edge on every game.</p>

          <div className="education-content">
            <p>Our <span className="key-term">"Fair Odds"</span> calculation uses what's called the <strong>best payout anchor method</strong>:</p>
            
            <div className="math-box">
              <strong>Step 1:</strong> For each outcome, find the best payout among major books (Pinnacle, DraftKings, FanDuel)<br/>
              <strong>Step 2:</strong> Use that same bookmaker's opposite side to maintain market consistency<br/>
              <strong>Step 3:</strong> Convert to probabilities and remove the bookmaker's built-in margin<br/>
              <strong>Step 4:</strong> Convert back to fair odds without any house edge

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Over payout:</strong> DraftKings -115 (vs FanDuel -125, Pinnacle -120)</li>
                <li><strong>DraftKings Under:</strong> -105 (use same book for consistency)</li>
                <li><strong>Remove DraftKings margin:</strong> 53.5% + 51.2% = 104.7% ‚Üí normalize</li>
                <li><strong>Fair Over odds:</strong> -108 (51.9% true probability)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>For the UNDER side:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Best Under payout:</strong> FanDuel -100 (vs DraftKings -105, Pinnacle -110)</li>
                <li><strong>FanDuel Over:</strong> -125 (use same book for consistency)</li>
                <li><strong>Remove FanDuel margin:</strong> 55.6% + 50.0% = 105.6% ‚Üí normalize</li>
                <li><strong>Fair Under odds:</strong> +109 (47.8% true probability)</li>
              </ul>
              
              <p><strong>Final Result:</strong> We take the calculation that gives us the most conservative (worst case) fair odds for our analysis.</p>
              <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Each outcome gets the best available pricing, and we maintain market consistency within each calculation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This method ensures we're not mixing different bookmakers' opinions while still getting the best available odds for our calculation.</p>

            <p>When you see our <span className="key-term">"Recommended Posting Odds"</span>, here's the math behind it:</p>
            
            <div className="concept-list">
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Target:</strong> 2.5% expected value after exchange fees</li>
