# FairEdge Deployment Readiness Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### ‚úÖ Environment Configuration
- [x] `.env.development` configured with development settings
- [x] `.env.production` configured with production settings  
- [x] Environment variables validated and documented
- [x] Security settings configured (fail-fast on unsafe defaults)
- [x] CORS origins properly configured for production

### ‚úÖ Code Quality
- [x] Unused code and dead imports removed
- [x] Comprehensive code comments added throughout
- [x] Documentation aligned with actual codebase
- [x] Development artifacts and test placeholders removed
- [x] Print statements replaced with proper logging

### ‚úÖ Security Implementation
- [x] JWT authentication with Supabase integration
- [x] Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
- [x] Rate limiting configured on all endpoints
- [x] CSRF protection with double-submit cookie pattern
- [x] httpOnly cookies for session management
- [x] Production security headers configured

### ‚úÖ Database & External Services
- [x] Database connection pooling configured
- [x] Redis caching implementation
- [x] Celery background task processing
- [x] External API client (The Odds API) with error handling
- [x] Database migration system (Alembic) configured

### ‚úÖ Error Handling & Monitoring
- [x] Comprehensive error handling throughout
- [x] Structured logging (JSON for production)
- [x] Health check endpoints implemented
- [x] Graceful degradation patterns
- [x] Performance monitoring setup

## Critical Items to Address Before Production

### üö® High Priority (Block Deployment)
- [ ] **Create Missing Test Files**: CI pipeline will fail without tests
  - Create `tests/test_smoke_ci.py`
  - Create `tests/locustfile.py` 
  - Create basic integration tests
- [ ] **Fix CI Pipeline**: Currently broken due to missing test files
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Set actual credentials in production `.env`
  - Replace all `CHANGE_ME` values
  - Verify Supabase credentials
  - Set secure admin secret (min 32 chars)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority (Post-Deployment)
- [ ] **Code Refactoring**: `app.py` is too large (1,926 lines)
  - Extract business logic to service layer
  - Split into domain-specific modules
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Load test the application
- [ ] **Monitoring Setup**: Configure alerts and dashboards

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Low Priority (Future Improvements)
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: Implement DI container
- [ ] **API Documentation**: Update OpenAPI specs
- [ ] **Frontend Testing**: Add React component tests

## Deployment Commands

### Development Environment
```bash
# 1. Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env.development

# 2. Configure your values
# Edit .env.development with actual credentials

# 3. Start services
./scripts/deploy.sh development

# 4. Verify deployment
./scripts/run_tests.sh smoke  # Will fail until tests are created
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# 1. Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env.production

# 2. Configure production values
# Edit .env.production with live credentials

# 3. Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy.sh production

# 4. Verify health
curl https://your-domain.com/health
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] API health endpoint responding: `/health`
- [ ] Database connectivity verified
- [ ] Redis caching functional
- [ ] Celery workers processing tasks
- [ ] Frontend loading correctly
- [ ] Authentication flow working

### Performance Checks  
- [ ] API response times < 2 seconds
- [ ] Background task processing
- [ ] Memory usage within limits
- [ ] CPU utilization normal

### Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS enforced in production
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] Rate limiting functional
- [ ] Authentication working correctly
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If issues occur during deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh stop
   # Restore previous version
   # Restart services
   ```

2. **Database Rollback** (if needed):
   ```bash
   alembic downgrade -1
   ```

3. **Cache Clearing**:
   ```bash
   # Clear Redis cache if needed
   redis-cli FLUSHALL
   ```

## Support and Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- API response time and error rates
- Database connection pool status  
- Redis memory usage
- Celery task queue length
- Active user sessions

### Log Locations
- Application logs: Structured JSON in stdout
- Database logs: PostgreSQL logs
- Background tasks: Celery worker logs
- Web server: Nginx access/error logs
