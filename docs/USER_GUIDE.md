### Understanding Expected Value (EV)

**Expected Value** represents the theoretical profit of a bet over time:

- **Positive EV (+EV)**: The bet is mathematically profitable long-term
- **Negative EV (-EV)**: The bet favors the bookmaker
- **Zero EV**: A break-even proposition

**Example**: A bet with +4.5% EV means you expect to profit $4.50 for every $100 wagered over time.

## How to Use Opportunities

### Reading Opportunity Data

Each opportunity card shows:

```
üèà Kansas City Chiefs @ Buffalo Bills
Moneyline: Chiefs Win
EV: +4.2% | Fair: 1.95 | Best: 2.05 | DraftKings
Time: 8:20 PM ET | Updated: 2 min ago
```

**Translation**: Betting on Chiefs to win has 4.2% positive EV. Fair odds are 1.95, but DraftKings offers 2.05, creating the edge.

### Best Practices

1. **Bankroll Management**: Never bet more than 2-5% of bankroll on single bet
2. **Shop Lines**: Verify odds at the recommended bookmaker
3. **Act Quickly**: Odds change frequently; good opportunities disappear fast
4. **Track Results**: Monitor your betting performance over time
5. **Understand Variance**: EV is long-term; expect ups and downs

### Timing Your Bets

- **Fresh Opportunities**: Best EV often appears when lines first open
- **Line Movement**: Watch for steam moves that reduce EV
- **Game Time**: Opportunities may decrease closer to start time
- **Live Betting**: Some EV exists in-game, but moves very quickly
